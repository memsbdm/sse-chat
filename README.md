# Real-Time Chat with SSE and Inertia

## Goal

Create a real-time chat application using Server Sent Events (SSE) instead of Websockets. Utilize Inertia.js to seamlessly integrate Adonis.js backend with Svelte.js frontend.

## Technologies Used

- [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/): A powerful Node.js framework for building web applications.
- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/): A library that allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that comes with modern SPAs.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A radical new approach to building user interfaces.
- [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/): A protocol allowing to push data updates to web browsers and other HTTP clients in a convenient, fast, reliable, and battery-efficient way.

## Getting Started

To launch the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 
5. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
